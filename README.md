- 👋 Hi, I’m @EricTomaszewski, 39yo M in London

**- 👀 I’m interested in:**
- Python in general
- => while for specifics - see next 2 paragraphs: 
- => basically everything that I'm currently learning
- => and the project that I focus on which scrapes Financial Data to get info for Financing
 
**- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...**
- scraping (Selenium, Scrapy, BeautifulSoup)
- APIs (OpenAI: ChatGPT, Whisper, Dall-e; LinkedIn and other social media platforms)
- Databases (MySQL)
- Web Apps (Flask, Django, Streamlit)
- Computer Vision (OpenCV, Pillow, TensorFlow => training algorithm to recognize >>>SPECIFIC<<< objects & faces)
- Data Science & Machine Learning (various, see my githubs: https://github.com/EricTomaszewski/-MachineLearning & https://github.com/EricTomaszewski/-DataScience)
 
**- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on**
- => this combination of FINANCE, SCRAPING & DATA in Python:
- https://www.reddit.com/r/progether/comments/10dt7xe/im_in_london_do_you_want_to_progether_in_python/
- (one from general web and another one - focused purely on LinkedIn
- => with something to show for it already but the project could really do with a person who knows Flask
- 1. or other web app stuff
- 2. plus databases
- 3. and finally - cloud computing to deploy it / perhaps Docker/Kubernetes?
- these 3 things is the expertise I'm yet to learn and could do with from people who dealt with it before)
 
**- 📫 How to reach me:**
- => CONNECT ON LINKEDIN: https://www.linkedin.com/in/irotom/ (but please, PLEASE leave an introduction message with the invite how you found me)
- => or drop me a message on Whatsapp: https://bit.ly/ItomaEricWhatsapp
